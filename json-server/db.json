His jaw dropped.\n“He looked at me in disbelief so I put the phone on speaker and the lady confirmed we’d won £100,770.”\nKathleen, Mark and their daughter and two sons all sat in the kitchen staring at each other before hiding the winning ticket in Mark’s passport for safekeeping.\n“I’ve always wanted to foster children,” said Kathleen. “Mark and I discussed it many years ago and then we had our own.\n“My three kids will be leaving home soon and I have too much love to give. I’ve always wanted to foster, however having enough space has always been an issue.”\nKathleen, a full-time teaching assistant said the win was a brilliant way to finish off her summer break.",

He\"s also charged with illegally possessing an alligator and petty theft. Jail records show he was released on $6,000 bail Tuesday. He was ordered to have no contact with animals.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Wildlife officer Nicholas Guerin said in his report that James drove his pickup truck to the window at about 1:20 a.m. Oct. 11. After an employee handed James his drink, he threw the alligator through the window and drove off. No one was hurt. Guerin captured the alligator and released it into the wild. Guerin said James was tracked down through video surveillance and a purchase at a neighboring convenience store.</p><aside aria-label=\"advertisement\" class=\"gnt_m gnt_x gnt_x__lbl gnt_x__al\"><div data-g-r=\"lazy\" data-gl-method=\"lazyLoadX\" id=\"ad-slot-7103-fl-jacksonville-C6588-native-article_link-news-2\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\" data-google-query-id=\"CKmsgpinlIEDFdOTgwgdmQYO_g\"><div id=\"google_ads_iframe_7103/fl-jacksonville-C6588/native-article_link/news_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\"><iframe class=\"gnt_x_sl_gpt_if\" id=\"google_ads_iframe_7103/fl-jacksonville-C6588/native-article_link/news_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_7103/fl-jacksonville-C6588/native-article_link/news_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" allow=\"attribution-reporting\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; width: 300px; height: 250px;\" data-load-complete=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"2\" data-integralas-id-81cc7550-ff3c-9a27-a565-783f9516e772=\"\"></iframe></div></div></aside><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Guerin wrote that James admitted throwing the alligator in a December interview.

Ross, a retired scientist at the University of Florida\"s Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation, said a 3.5-foot alligator would likely weigh about 20 to 30 pounds, and its hard body could deliver quite a jolt if it struck someone.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">He said the gator\"s bite would be comparable to a dog\"s and would be unlikely to cause serious injury or snap off a finger, although it could tear tendons.
