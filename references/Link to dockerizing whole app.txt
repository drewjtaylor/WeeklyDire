Note about making dockerfile actually build instead of running dev version

React example
When building React applications, you need a Node environment to compile the JS code (typically JSX), SASS stylesheets, and more into static HTML, JS, and CSS. If you aren't doing server-side rendering, you don't even need a Node environment for your production build. You can ship the static resources in a static nginx container.

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM node:18 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package* yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install
COPY public ./public
COPY src ./src
RUN yarn run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
In the previous Dockerfile example, it uses the node:18 image to perform the build (maximizing layer caching) and then copies the output into an nginx container.
