Test what happens if an article has no tags on fullArticle (article 6 in json-server)

Make "tagged article list" for user to click an article, then be brought to a page where only articles with that tag show up

Make a "search by tag" modal (tagSearchModal)

Make a better looking error component.

Write a "tags" box into the "write" page.
Enter tags one at a time, display a list of "pending tags" (with 'x's to allow removing tags)
On "submit", the full list of tags should be the accumulated list of pending tags

***After back end/DB implementation***

Calls to "selectarticlebyid" calls ALL articles, then uses "find()" to pick one. It would be less expensive to have the back end provide just one article, rather than all of them every time

Uninstall json-server, get rid of "json-server" folder after a real database is connected

Make /write actually send info to the database
make /write require the signed in user to be a contributor

Add error validation to LoginForm and Register Form


***"Icing on the cake" ideas.***
These are not part of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Once the basics are all DONE and polished, these features can be added.
No working on these until the MVP is DONE.

--Write page changes
Add a "publish time" to the "Write" page to allow creators to choose when their articles go live
Add an "Edit" page to creators can change existing articles (that THEY wrote) (keep previous versions?)
Add a spot for "highlight quote" for article, and render it in a large bold section aside on its display page
Instead of a thumbnail, allow uploading files (which would then need altered for storage?)
