Make a "search by tag" modal and link to it on the home page (tagSearchModal)

Make a better looking error component.

Add error validation to LoginForm and Register Form

***After back end/DB implementation***

Calls to "selectarticlebyid" calls ALL articles, then uses "find()" to pick one. It would be less expensive to have the back end provide just one article, rather than all of them every time

Uninstall json-server, get rid of "json-server" folder after a real database is connected

Make /write actually send info to the database through the back end
make /write require the signed in user to be a contributor



***"Icing on the cake" ideas.***
These are not part of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Once the basics are all DONE and polished, these features can be added.
No working on these until the MVP is DONE.

--Write page changes
Add a "publish time" to the "Write" page to allow creators to choose when their articles go live
Add an "Edit" page to creators can change existing articles (that THEY wrote) (keep previous versions?)
Add a spot for "highlight quote" for article, and render it in a large bold section aside on its display page
Instead of a thumbnail, allow uploading files (which would then need altered for storage?)
