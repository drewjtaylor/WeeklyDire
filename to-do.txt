Make a modal show up on "logout," notifying the user

Make a "search by tag" modal and link to it on the home page (tagSearchModal)

Make "logout" look like the sign in button

Make write form not need all fields (articlesRouter post action needs logic fixed)

More gracefully handle failed login attempts
More gracefully handle error on the "/write" form

On write form, if non-creator tries to write, handle error more gracefully
Block "write" from access to non-creators and writers to begin with (other than just in express)

Make a better looking error component.

Add error validation to LoginForm and Register Form
Make register/sign in forms look better.


***After back end/DB implementation***

Implement an "admin" page on the front, and connect up some of the database functions
For example, have the ability to list out all articles, and have a button to delete them.

username getting entered twice when using register? (username is automatically done by passport I think,
or passport-local-mongoose. Remove from front end submission and manual entry on route(s))

Clean up all "post" implementation in front end. Could be more concise.
Anywhere that has the "postData" function can just be combined with
whatever function is under it (handleSubmit/login, etc)

Turn on "authentication" lines on routes. Test with postman
Fix commentsRouter comment.create using the body username, and instead make it use the logged in user.

Rethink routes for manipulating comments. The most sensible is probably:
"[articleId]/comments", then do CRUD operations from there. Move app.use(commentsRouter) from 'app.js' to articlesRouter.js'?

(After auth) Change article delete route to require admin

Calls to "selectarticlebyid" calls ALL articles, then uses "find()" to pick one. It would be less expensive to have the back end provide just one article, rather than all of them every time

Make a basic "Error/this doesn't exist" page for server errors




***Dockerizing***

IF (and it's a big if) I decide to dockerize this project...

Example: https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/react-express-mongodb

Change root/username in yml file to be variables

Use a mounted folder for data so it persists: https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume





***Before adding to portfolio***

Read and update readme






***"Icing on the cake" ideas.***
These are not part of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Once the basics are all DONE and polished, these features can be added.
No working on these until the MVP is DONE.

--Write page changes
Add a "publish time" to the "Write" page to allow creators to choose when their articles go live
Add an "Edit" page to creators can change existing articles (that THEY wrote) (keep previous versions?) Use "PUT" route.
Add a spot for "highlight quote" for article, and render it in a large bold section aside on its display page
Instead of a thumbnail, allow uploading files (which would then need altered for storage?)


--"Change password" functionality for users. https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local-mongoose
