"WeeklyDire" is a fictional news site themed around finding the silver lining in tragedy.

The ultimate purpose is to show what I am capable of as a developer, but hopefully a secondary effect will be your inspiration at some of these stories.

This app is comprised of a front end built with React, a back end using node/express, and a database using MongoDB.

## Front end (React)

Routing: react-router-dom
Styling and layout: Bootstrap/Rectstrap
Forms: Formik
Iconography: fontawesome

### Home page
The home page displays all articles from an asynchronous request to the server.

Clicking one of the cards displaying articles leads to a full page

Clicking to "Log In" or "Register" at the top right opens an appropriate modal with a form.

The footer



## Back end (Node/Express)


## Database (MongoDB)

Will connect to database and node/Express server later
